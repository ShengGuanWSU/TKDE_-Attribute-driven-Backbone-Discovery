\section {Conclusion}

We have introduced attributed backbones, 
which explicitly incorporate affinitive attributes 
to interpret connectivity in attributed networks. 
We have developed both approximation and 
fast heuristics, to cope with backbone detection 
in networks with small number of attributes, and 
with large attribute size and no explicitly specified 
edge cost model, respectively. 
Our experimental study verified that 
these algorithms can efficiently identify 
interpretable critical structures that 
cannot be identified by conventional 
community detection. 
A future work is to generalize 
our methods to identify 
attribute-driven graphs 
under constraints such as density. \warn{add more about online part.}
